"https://ptb.de/dcc/ont/","DCC Ontology@en","Individual","","","","","This ontology is designed to be used in conjunction with:
- SIS Ontology (https://ptb.de/sis/) for numeric quantity values
- OMT Ontology (http://www.nmdc.com/ontology/OMT) for VIM-compliant terminology
- W3C PROV-O for provenance tracking
- ProvONE for workflow provenance (optional)
- SI Digital Framework for unit references

OMT Integration Rationale:
The OMT (Ontology for Measurement Terminology) provides VIM-compliant semantics
that complement the DCC structural model. While DCC focuses on certificate structure,
OMT provides richer semantics for measurement concepts. Key alignment points:
- dcc:MeasurementResult ↔ omt:MeasurementResult (VIM 2.9)
- dcc:UsedMethod ↔ omt:MeasurementMethod (VIM 2.5) / omt:MeasurementProcedure (VIM 2.6)
- dcc:InfluenceCondition ↔ omt:OperatingCondition
- dcc:MeasuringEquipment ↔ omt:MeasuringInstrument
- dcc:CalibrationItem ↔ omt:MeasuredObject
- SIS uncertainty classes ↔ omt:MeasurementUncertainty hierarchy@en","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This ontology provides a version-agnostic abstraction layer over the PTB DCC XML schema,
enabling machine-interpretable calibration data exchange aligned with VIM/GUM standards.

Key design principles:
1. Complete schema coverage: All DCC XML types are represented
2. Rigorous cardinality restrictions: Mirrors SIS ontology patterns
3. SIS integration: Numeric payloads delegate to sis: classes for GUM compliance
4. OMT alignment: Links to VIM-compliant measurement terminology
5. PROV hooks: Provenance-related classes extend prov: terms
6. Qualification pattern: refType/refId system follows PROV qualification pattern
7. Language handling: Uses RDF language tags (@en, @de) per SIS pattern@en"
