## Motivation

The D-SI ontology (SIS) provides a generic framework for a complete semantic description of numerical quantity values conform to the BIPM brochure, the VIM and the GUM. It covers .............

The SIS ontology is developed at PTB within the working group on "Data for metrology" / in the framework of ..... and it evolves continuously thanks to a fruitful exchange with some standardization initiatives covering different use cases about metrological services and research data management: the workforce on Digital Calibration Certificates and the workgroup "Metadata4Ing".

## Usage

The ontology SIS is a collection of terms (classes and properties) which can be used to enrich a research data set with semantic and machine-readable metadata, in order to annotate it or to integrate it in a database or a larger knowledge graph. The metadata can be serialized in formats like [JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/), [YAML-LD](https://json-ld.github.io/yaml-ld/spec/) or [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/). More details about these semantic formats and detailed instructions how to semantically describe a data set and its generation process are collected in ....., together with practical examples. 

## Design

The collected classes and properties are organised in a logical and hierarchical structure and either self-defined within SIS, or reused [from other ontologies](#5-references). Subordinate classes and relations can be built according to the two principles of _inheritance_ and _modularity_. _Inheritance_ means that a subclass inherits all properties of its superordinate class, possibly adding some new ones. _Modularity_ means that all expansions are independent of each other; this makes possible for instance to generate expanded ontologies for any possible combinations of method × object of research. New concepts and properties are located in the namespace of SIS (`sis:`).

For readability and compatibility reasons, SIS does not import complete ontologies. Instead, it references single existing classes and properties on which the `sis` classes and properties are based, including either their identifiers, or a relevant subset of the axioms from the original ontology. <!-- Whenever the original set of statements about an entity needed to be extended or modified (e.g. because labels and definitions in any of the supported languages were missing, or expressed with a different owl:AnnotationProperty than the rest of SIS), the corresponding editorial changes were declared in SIS by an annotation with skos:editorialNote at item-level. To get the original set of statements we encourage to visit the original namespace of the respective item. -->


## Availability

The SIS ontology is available for download as a whole in several serializations: [TTL](https://ptb.gitlab.io/dcc/ontology-d-si/ontology.ttl), [N-Triples](https://ptb.gitlab.io/dcc/ontology-d-si/ontology.nt), [RDF/XML](https://ptb.gitlab.io/dcc/ontology-d-si/ontology.owl) and [JSON-LD](https://ptb.gitlab.io/dcc/ontology-d-si/ontology.jsonld).

Application profiles in form of SHACL shapes (serialized in TTL) are available to ease validation for the following classes/profiles: ..............

## General structure of an ontology

An ontology models a defined knowledge sector by introducing classes and properties. A **class** stands for a group of individuals that all share some common properties. A **subclass** stands for a subset of this group. For example, the class [Quantity numerical value](#QuantityValue) is the most general class for the numerical value of a variable; [complex value](#Complex) is a subclass of [Quantity numerical value](#QuantityValue); the complex magnetic flux density measured in the lab ABC in the experiment XY is an **instance** of these classes, i.e. a **named individual** belonging to the class _Quantity numerical value_ and the subclass _complex value_. No individuals are included in the main ontology, but a list of [_constants_](#Constant) is attached in a separate file.

Properties that are attributes of a class are called **datatype properties**. For instance, a [_univariate uncertainty declaration_](#ProcessingStep) has the following datatype properties: [_uncertainty value_](#hasUncertaintyValue), [_unit string_](#hasUnitString). The **range** of a property defines the data type of a property. For example, a [_unit string_](#hasunitString) has as a range a `xsd:string` with a particular formatting; a [_coverage probability_](#.....) has the range `xsd:double` with the restriction $0<P<1$; a [_time stamp_](#hasDatetime) the range _date with time_. A property's **domain** lists the classes that have this property as an attribute.

Relations between classes that can be used to interlink instances of these classes are called **object properties**. So a quantity numerical value [_has as uncertainty expression_](#hasUncertaintyDeclaration) one of the several kinds of [_uncertainty declaration_](#UncertaintyDeclaration), so "[_has as uncertainty expression_](#hasUncertaintyDeclaration)" is an object property with domain [_Quantity numerical value_](#Tool) and range [_uncertainty declaration_](#UncertaintyDeclaration).

This documentation lists all the classes, datatype properties, object properties and individuals that are defined by SIS or reused from other ontologies.
